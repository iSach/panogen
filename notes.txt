depth = (diameter in px at 1m) / (diameter in px on image)
ppm: 9.52px/cm

Basket ball: 
  - Distance: 1m -> radius = 226px
  - Distance: 2m -> radius = 113px
  - Real diameter: 23.8cm (11.9cm)

Foot ball:
  - Distance: 1m -> diameter = 100px
  - Distance: 2m -> diameter = 50px
  - Real diameter: 10.5cm (5.25cm)
  - Should be: at 1.5m: 67px
                  0.5m: 200px

Qualitative notes:
 * We should use a low confidence level on detection because we want more FPs over FNs.
 * Instance Segmentation way too slow even the best model will never fit for real-time, no need to compare
 * We need to evaluate in real-time on Jetson what it gives, and try out different methods for the mask.
 * Ball bounding box mask: can use a simple circle. For persons, either a rectangle, or an ellipse?
 * Not enough data to train a new model only on the 2 classes which would be way faster
 * models work on RGB by default, we need to compare RGB vs grayscale in accuracy
     L-> Turning on RGB makes: * reading slower (about 2 times it seems)
                               * mAP inside person decreases
                               * mAP outside person same
                               * mAP ball increases (x2) everywhere
 * ellipse with person: will let hands go out so might not give a good mask for panorama
 * Like for FP, we prefer masking too much than not enough, gain in accuracy maybe not needed.
