Qualitative notes:
 * We should use a low confidence level on detection because we want more FPs over FNs.
 * Instance Segmentation way too slow even the best model will never fit for real-time, no need to compare
 * We need to evaluate in real-time on Jetson what it gives, and try out different methods for the mask.
 * Ball bounding box mask: can use a simple circle. For persons, either a rectangle, or an ellipse?
 * Not enough data to train a new model only on the 2 classes which would be way faster
 * models work on RGB by default, we need to compare RGB vs grayscale in accuracy
     L-> Turning on RGB makes: * reading slower (about 2 times it seems)
                               * mAP inside person decreases
                               * mAP outside person same
                               * mAP ball increases (x2) everywhere
 * ellipse with person: will let hands go out so might not give a good mask for panorama
 * Like for FP, we prefer masking too much than not enough, gain in accuracy maybe not needed.
